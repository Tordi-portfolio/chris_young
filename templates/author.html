    <div class="author-title">All About Jason Momoa</div>

    <div class="author-block">
      <span>Jason Momoa</span> is more than a Hollywood name—he’s a creative force of nature. Known for his legendary roles as <span>Aquaman</span> and <span>Khal Drogo</span>, Jason brings strength, vulnerability, and authenticity to every screen he steps onto. But his story doesn’t stop at the surface.
    </div>

    <div class="author-block">
      As a <span>producer, director, and writer</span>, Jason is deeply involved in shaping the stories he tells. He founded <span>Pride of Gypsies</span>, a production company focused on soulful, untamed, and visually arresting work. He doesn’t just act—he crafts experiences.
    </div>

    <div class="author-block">
      When he's not on set, Jason is in the wild—<span>rock climbing, surfing, building motorcycles</span>, or sitting in the dirt with his children. His soul belongs to nature, and he’s a vocal advocate for <span>clean oceans, sustainable living, and Indigenous rights</span>.
    </div>

    <div class="author-block">
      Family is everything. Culture is everything. Jason proudly honors his <span>Native Hawaiian roots</span>, and raises his kids with values of respect, earth connection, and fearlessness. He’s not trying to be perfect—he’s trying to be real.
    </div>

    <div class="author-block">
      Whether he’s sketching a tattoo design, building a custom bike, filming a documentary, or hugging a tree, Jason lives a life of fire, creation, and love. His work is bold. His legacy is rising. And through it all, he stays grounded by his people, his passions, and his purpose.
    </div>

    <div class="quote">
      "I want to use my life to protect the things I love—my family, my culture, and this earth. That’s the legacy I care about.”<br>— Jason Momoa
